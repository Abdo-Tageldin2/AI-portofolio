	•	Key Topics Covered:
	•	Privacy and data protection issues arising from AI.
	•	Algorithmic bias and fairness concerns.
	•	The socioeconomic impact, including job displacement due to automation.
	•	Ethical considerations in AI-driven decision-making.
	•	Outcome: Demonstrated a nuanced understanding of ethical challenges and proposed strategies for ethically responsible AI deployment.

2. Human-Centred AI Design
	•	Task: Designed a user interface (UI) for an AI-powered system using Figma, emphasizing usability, transparency, accessibility, and trust-building.
	•	Focus: Clearly communicated AI capabilities and limitations, ensuring user-friendly interactions and fostering confidence in AI technology.

3. Supervised Learning: Spam Detection
	•	Task: Implemented a binary classification model for spam detection utilizing supervised learning techniques.
	•	Tools & Techniques: Python, Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression/Naive Bayes), Pandas, NumPy.
	•	Outcome: Conducted data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, and performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix).

4. Reasoning and Problem-Solving Techniques
	•	Task: Compared and critically analyzed two reasoning methods: Game Theory and Bayesian Reasoning.
	•	Analysis: Explained foundational principles, applications, and limitations of each method.
	•	Applications: Discussed practical scenarios illustrating effective usage of each reasoning technique in AI-driven problem-solving.

5. Expert System Development: Medical Diagnosis
	•	Task: Developed a rule-based expert system to perform basic medical diagnosis.
	•	Implementation: Formulated diagnostic rules connecting symptoms to possible conditions.
	•	Outcome: Demonstrated proficiency in expert system concepts, inference mechanisms, and practical rule formulation.

6. Markov Decision Process (MDP)
	•	Task: Created an MDP framework modeling a robot’s navigation through a grid environment.
	•	Elements Defined: Clearly outlined states, actions, transition probabilities, and rewards.
	•	Solution Approach: Solved the MDP using dynamic programming methods (value and policy iteration).
	•	Outcome: Gained hands-on experience in structured decision-making and dynamic programming algorithms.

7. Knowledge Representation
	•	Task: Analyzed and contrasted semantic networks and frames as methods for knowledge representation.
	•	Comparison: Identified strengths, weaknesses, and suitable application contexts for each method.
	•	Scenarios Provided: Illustrated the applicability of semantic networks and frames through practical examples.

8. Semantic Web Development
	•	Task: Explained the evolution and concept of the Semantic Web (Web 2.0, Web 3.0, and Web 4.0), including practical conceptual design.
	•	Conceptual Semantic Web Design:
	•	Domain: Movie Database
	•	Entities Defined: Movies, Actors, Directors
	•	Ontology Creation: Developed a simple ontology clearly defining entity relationships.
