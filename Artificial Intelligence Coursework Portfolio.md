Artificial Intelligence Coursework Portfolio

This repository contains projects and exercises completed as part of coursework in Artificial Intelligence, demonstrating my understanding and practical skills in various areas of AI, including Human-Centred Design, Supervised Learning, Reasoning Techniques, Expert Systems, Markov Decision Processes, Knowledge Representation, and Semantic Web Development.

Project Descriptions

1. Human-Centred AI Design
	•	Task: Designed a user interface (UI) for an AI-powered system using Figma, emphasizing user-friendliness, accessibility, and trustworthiness.
	•	Focus: Ensured the interface transparently communicates the system’s capabilities, limits, and rationale behind decisions to foster user confidence.

2. Supervised Learning: Spam Detection
	•	Task: Performed binary classification for spam detection using supervised learning with a real-world dataset.
	•	Tools & Techniques: Python, Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression/Naive Bayes classifier), Pandas for data analysis.
	•	Outcome: Demonstrated practical knowledge in dataset exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall).

3. Reasoning and Problem-Solving Techniques
	•	Task: Compared and contrasted Game Theory and Bayesian Reasoning.
	•	Analysis: Clearly outlined core principles, applications, strengths, and weaknesses of each method.
	•	Outcome: Provided insightful examples on how each reasoning approach could be effectively applied to AI-driven decision-making problems.

4. Expert System Development: Medical Diagnosis
	•	Task: Developed a rule-based expert system for basic medical diagnosis.
	•	Implementation: Used rule-based inference mechanisms to associate symptoms with potential diagnoses.
	•	Outcome: Illustrated knowledge of expert system architecture, rule formulation, and reasoning logic.

5. Markov Decision Process (MDP)
	•	Task: Created an MDP model for a robot navigating a grid environment.
	•	Elements: Defined states, actions, transition probabilities, and reward functions clearly.
	•	Solution Approach: Employed Dynamic Programming to compute optimal policies and state values.
	•	Outcome: Demonstrated proficiency in formulating and solving MDP problems.

6. Knowledge Representation
	•	Task: Explored semantic networks and frames as knowledge representation techniques.
	•	Comparison: Evaluated strengths and weaknesses of each technique through detailed scenarios.
	•	Applications: Provided practical scenarios where semantic networks and frames were best suited.

7. Semantic Web Development
	•	Task: Explained the concept and evolution of Semantic Web (Web 2.0, 3.0, 4.0), and developed a conceptual Semantic Web project.
	•	Conceptual Design:
	•	Domain: Movie Database
	•	Entities: Movies, Actors, Directors
	•	Ontology & Relationships: Developed a simple ontology demonstrating relationships and properties between entities.
	•	Implementation: Created RDF triples representing meaningful connections between entities, including concrete example instances.
